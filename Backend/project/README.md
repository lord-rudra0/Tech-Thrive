## Running Locally

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## Technologies Used

- React for the frontend
- Express for the backend API
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Google Maps API for map visualization
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Environment Setup

For the Google Maps integration to work properly, you need to:

1. Replace `YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in the `ForestMap.jsx` component with a valid Google Maps API key
2. Ensure the API key has the Maps JavaScript API enabled

## Data Source
